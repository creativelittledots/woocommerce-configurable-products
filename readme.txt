Create complex, configurable product kits and let your customers build their own, personalized versions.

The Composite product type is ideal for offering dynamic product kits made up of multiple components, such as custom computers, skateboards, gift-boxes and made-to-order jewellery.

The powerful Composite type makes building even the most complex product kit a breeze: To create a new Composite product, just add a few components, populate them with product options and adjust their layout.

Composite products can be fine-tuned to optimize the customer experience in a >wide range of applications: From adding a few products in a small bundle, to crafting a complex product kit builder with countless product options, the extension gives you all the bundling functionality and layout options you need to keep your customers engaged and maximize conversion.
